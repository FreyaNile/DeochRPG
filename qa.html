<br><br><br>
FreyaNile: Heyoo my names Jackie, I often go by Freya Nile online. My game Deoch is a TTRPG that I’ve been working on full time for two years, it was developed for my personal games but I now run it exclusively and wanted to share it with everyone!
<br><br>
Dan: Thanks, FreyaNile! The floor is open to questions!
<br><br>
Dan: What is the premise of Deoch? (And is it pronounced “Dee-ock”?)(edited)
<br><br>
FreyaNile: Aye, you nailed the pronunciation. The premise of Deoch has evolved over its conception. As a pro GM, I was constantly running into awkward mechanics while running my favourite games and I wanted to create something that was a compilation of my efforts to find and prove lasting solutions to these issues I ran into. In short, it’s looking to find the balance of capturing the big immersive facets TTRPG’s while opening the door of accessibility.
<br><br>
FreyaNile: Mechanics are the #1 priority for me, i like things to run smooth
<br><br>
Silverlion: What are the mechanics like? Do you have a character sheet we can see?
<br><br>
FreyaNile: I do have a character sheet, ill locate that in just a moment here. Anyone familiar with 5e will pick up the game super quick, it’s meant to be familiar but I would say there’s alot more emphasis on freedom of your character choices and more weight on choices due do the lack of traditional death saves
<br><br>
Mylk: Are there any new spells added to your game? If so, what would you say is your favorite?
<br><br>
Dan: Does the game have a setting, or is it strictly a system?
<br><br>
FreyaNile: Heres the character sheet, first image is the inside and layout is correct, the second image is the outside and the back is on the left and the front is on the right, not the best pictures just snipped em quicklyImageImage
<br><br>
FreyaNile: As for the spells in the game, I have rewritten over 100 spells to include, mostly original takes on previous ideas some original spells. Haaaaaaard call but my favourites would have to be the custom powerwords
<br><br>
FreyaNile: The game does have a setting, aye. The lands of Tirnoch, set on a lemniscate orbit of two suns with custom gods that the paladins and clerics, and furthermore the populace know are real(edited)
<br><br>
FreyaNile: A revolution around a single star takes 112 days and are alternatingly referred to as Tir’s and Io’s for the respective sun that is most directly being orbited. The “long day” is a period in the middle of summer where there is no night due to the light exposure from both stars; this event marks the new year.
<br><br>
Dan: What’s the genre of the setting?
<br><br>
FreyaNile: The genre is low-mid fantasy, a good deal of emphasis of survival with room for higher fantasy in the later game, nothing groundbreaking in terms of the genre.(edited)
<br><br>
Dan: Does the game feature the “standard” fantasy races? Elves, Dwarves, Halflings, Orcs, etc.?
<br><br>
FreyaNile: Yes, we have the Or’uk (the orcs), the Aegisheir (the humans), the Old Elves (now extinct) the Nhazuulians (red dragonborn descendants) and the Dweller (the dwarfs). Furthermore, there is a half-elf mix for each heritage.
<br><br>
FreyaNile: Although the old elves are extinct their heritage traits are accessible when choosing a half elf
<br><br>
Dan: How common is magic, and how powerful does it get?
<br><br>
FreyaNile: It depends where you are in the setting, in Milith magic is quite forbidden due to their fear of elfrot, they may treat you as if you were contagious. Whereas other places may be ignorant or unaware of the dangers of magic or they may know the dangers but continue to use it anyway.
<br><br>
FreyaNile: Magic gets quite powerful towards the end of the game, but its always a balance between the dangers of magic and the lure of its power
<br><br>
Dan: How civilized is the setting? In particular, how likely is the average person to have seen a monster?
<br><br>
FreyaNile: What a great question. There is a good deal of a civilization, a history of kingdoms that have established and fallen. As for how often a commoner would be to see a monster, I try to keep the setting grounded so most of the lower level monsters you’d find in Tirnoch would be considered dangerous or exotic wildlife, so commoners have a good chance they would have seen those kind monsters if they travel, as you get into the higher level creatures the familiarity would wane.(edited)
<br><br>
Dan: Are there any organized groups of sapient monsters? Would the Or’uk fall into that category, for example?
<br><br>
GOFGrumpyOldFart: "FreyaNile: Magic gets quite powerful towards the end of the game, but its always a balance between the dangers of magic and the lure of its powe" 
<br><br>
There’s an end? Is the game not open ended then?
<br><br>
FreyaNile: The Or’uk would be the closest example that comes to mind when thinking of groups of monsters working together, aye. There is an established civilization of the Or’uk but it is in it’s infancy and not wholly united, so there are still wild Or’uk tribes.
<br><br>
FreyaNile: The game is open ended, I was speaking more in terms of what I would consider later game creatures. For example, a pack of wolves or ankheg could be a lower level monsters, whereas a giant purple worm would be a later game monster that commoners would be less familiar with
<br><br>
GOFGrumpyOldFart: Just trying to clarify. No problem.
<br><br>
FreyaNile: No worries. I just noticed that your question was directed at my statement about magic, not creatures ! In that instance I was referring to level 1 vs level 10 spells, hope that clears that up! (:
<br><br>
Dan: I gather that the gods are quite active in this setting. How clear-cut is the setting’s morality? Good vs. Evil? Shades of gray?
<br><br>
FreyaNile: I have removed alignment completely from the mechanics so I would definitely say shades of grey.
<br><br>
GOFGrumpyOldFart: I’ve always felt that even for a cleric, your “alignment” isn’t what’s important. What’s important is how closely you follow the tenets of your religion. Not the same thing.
<br><br>
Dan: Even so, are there any clearly evil creatures, like demons and devils?
<br><br>
FreyaNile: The only demons are the ones we carry with us. Haha no, but in all seriousness, the mindless undead are considered universally reviled. There is a god of death/balance/war/decay: Sgrios. To worship this god is quite taboo and the creatures you find in his realm could also be considered of that caliber.
<br><br>
Dan: Generally speaking, who are the PCs, and what do they do? Are they your traditional “adventurer” types?
<br><br>
FreyaNile: They are nobodies. I wanted the focus to be on character progression. There is no backstory crafting in the character creation of Deoch, the backstory is meant to be cultivated organically through gameplay and forged over the time you spend playing, the stories you and your comrades experienced together and can look back on. As they grow more powerful and their connection grow more vast they find themselves in situations with bigger and bigger stakes.
<br><br>
FreyaNile: i like to think every hero was a nobody at some point
<br><br>
GOFGrumpyOldFart: "FreyaNile: The only demons are the ones we carry with us. Haha no, but in all seriousness, the mindless undead are considered universally reviled. There is a god of death/balance/war/decay: Sgrios. To worship this god is quite taboo and the creatures you find in his realm could also be considered of that caliber." 
<br><br>
Not to step on your ideas, but I recently had a player who wanted to play, “a necromancer, but not evil.” To that end, I created a Shaman class whose job is to make sure the spirits of the dead find their closure and gain their rest. Sometimes that involves summoning an undead spirit and letting it have its vengeance. Do with that idea what you will.
<br><br>
GOFGrumpyOldFart: The most obvious difference between them and “typical” necromancers is that they deal in spirits, not bodies.
<br><br>
FreyaNile: The spirits can definitely come in many demeanors and something like that wouldn’t be farfetched within Deoch! It’s just how the commoners would react to seeing it, they may consider it “taboo” or “evil” when in reality its all perspective
<br><br>
Dan: What classes are available to play?
<br><br>
FreyaNile: Barbarian, Fighter, Monk, Ranger, Rogue, Wizard, Sorcerer, Druid, Cleric and Paladin.
<br><br>
FreyaNile: Theres a bardic option within the rogue for the bard lovers
<br><br>
TriDemp: Earlier you had mentioned making it more accessible?, im just curious in what ways?
<br><br>
Dan: What is the game’s basic task resolution mechanic? What dice are used, and how?
<br><br>
FreyaNile: I prioritize writing the most I can with as little words as possible so players have less to write down. I removed mechanics that created slog, confusion or awkwardness at the table and introduced many custom mechanics that produce a weighty and immersive feeling to play. The book itself is jam packed with information and boasts a modest page count of 60 pages. The only art within the book is the cover and chapter art which takes up space that would have otherwise been blank. The character creation is on just 2 pages so theres no endless flipping through the book, all your options are on those pages and there is no shortage of options either.(edited)
<br><br>
FreyaNile: The primary task resolution is d20 vs DC.
<br><br>
Dan: I didn’t see a place for skills on the character sheet. Is everything 100% attribute-based?
<br><br>
FreyaNile: Ya I went ahead and removed skills, that was one of the longest changes to come to a conclusion on. I always felt they were unwieldly so I tried a system of reduced skills for a while and in the end it felt redundant once all the other changes came together so it is just based on the stat and mod
<br><br>
Dan: What are the modifiers? Character level, for example?
<br><br>
FreyaNile: Sorry, could you elaborate on your question further?
<br><br>
Dan: Well, I mean, what numbers modify the rolls aside from the attribute scores? Do you add the PC’s level directly to relevant rolls, for example?
<br><br>
FreyaNile: Oh I see. Your standard roll would look like d20 + proficiency bonus (which is based on your level) + stat mod (STR, DEX, CON, WIS, INT, CHA) or just a d20 + stat mod if you are not proficient in the task or save
<br><br>
Dan: Does class provide the list of proficiencies?
<br><br>
FreyaNile: Magic items or mastercraft items could offer +1 and such
<br><br>
FreyaNile: At character creation you get to choose a stat to be proficient in. Weapon and armour proficiency were play tested but are no longer in the final game. The only proficiencies that are tied to class are your save proficiencies. (the rogue does get some other boons to proficiency)
<br><br>
FreyaNile: Language proficiency has been split up into verbal and literacy. Toolkits have standard proficiency and expertise (x2 pb)
<br><br>
TriDemp: Whats the max level?
<br><br>
FreyaNile: I went with 10 as a cap for the level. This leaves room for some “prestige class” potential and I like a level 10 cap when considering gesalt classing
<br><br>
Dan: "FreyaNile: At character creation you get to choose a stat to be proficient in. Weapon and armour proficiency were play tested but are no longer in the final game. The only proficiencies that are tied to class are your save proficiencies. (the rogue does get some other boons to proficiency"
<br><br>
So does this mean that, for example, a character can’t get any better at public speaking, but must rely instead on the straight attribute (Charisma, presumably)?
<br><br>
FreyaNile: Oh no, theres tons of room for improvement. You don’t roll for stats. Instead all stats start at 9 and you start with 3 stats points to allocate as you choose. When you level up you gain an additional 2 stats. This prioritizes character progression and you never have to choose between getting your stat improvement or a feat, youll get both.
<br><br>
FreyaNile: Within character creation you will have points to allocate into lanaguage and that will determine your ability to communicate through language barriers. Past character creation you can learn new languages if you so choose.(edited)
<br><br>
Dan: How does combat work?
<br><br>
Dan: (And are you doing okay on time? We’re up against 2 hours, but I have a few more question to ask, if you’re able.)
<br><br>
FreyaNile: I am more than happy to stay to answer some more questions! Combat works pretty traditionally. Roll initiative and then duke it out OR work it out with words, not every battle has to be a battle of brawn. Initiative works a bit different I have two mechanics I propose for this, ill just grab the excerpt from the book: “When combat begins, everyone makes a DEX check. The players are a unit and will take the highest of the results among them and contest it against the GM’s result. Whichever result is highest wins, taking their turn first, the players take their turn together. A round depicts 6 seconds and is over when both sides have taken their turn. Once everyone has taken a turn, the fight continues to the next round if neither side has stopped the combat.” A notable change to initiative is the combat sense mechanic: “Immediately after initiative is rolled, allow the players to make an INT or WIS check to see what they know about the enemies. The result determines the outcome: DC 5: You know the creatures AC. DC 15: Choose one piece of info to gain from: immunities, resistances, speed, vulnerabilities or notable abilities, Natural 20: You gain a +1 bonus to your critical range against the enemy. “
<br><br>
Dan: That’s kinda clever. 🙂
<br><br>
FreyaNile: thanks! (:
<br><br>
Dan: I notice that the character sheet has both Armor Class and Damage Reduction. Does armor work both ways in this system?
<br><br>
FreyaNile: Aye, so armor class works traditionally, it serves as your DC that others need to roll against to hit you. Damage reduction comes into play after you’ve been hit.
<br><br>
FreyaNile: I have a online character sheet im working on on my website you can check it out here: https://deochrpg.com/charactersheet.htmlCharacter BuilderWebpage description goes here
<br><br>
GOFGrumpyOldFart: I remember back in AD&D that Armor Class was the effectiveness of the armor, your ability to dodge blows, luck, the favor of the Gods, etc. I prefer games that split the effectiveness of the armor out from the rest.
<br><br>
Dan: So does armor both make you harder to hit and reduce damage after a hit?
<br><br>
FreyaNile: (Internet dropped had to move over to my phone) Armour class only comes into play when sorting out if a creature has been hit, it does not affect the damage a creature receives, but damage reduction does. For example, i have 16 AC and 3 DR. My opponent rolls a 17 to hit, I’m hit. They roll a 8 for damage but since I have 3 DR i take 5 damage. To further make the distinction armour provides AC and shields provide DR
<br><br>
Dan: Really? Huh. I would have thought the reverse.
<br><br>
Dan: Since shields are effectively a parry that prevents a blow from landing, while armor soaks up blows that get through.
<br><br>
FreyaNile: When you think of it like that you could swap them and it would make sense. My train of thought was standardization, I thought it may be confusing to new comers why armour isn’t the thing to give the armour class.
<br><br>
Dan: Well, you could always change the terminology. I can see how “Armor Class” would be misleading if you took my suggestion.
<br><br>
FreyaNile: I try to tow a fine line between what is already familiar. Since the concept and the term armour class is already considerably well known I opted to stick with the well known term. There is a few instances where I opted for this route for accessibilities sake.
<br><br>
Dan: How does spellcasting work, and what are the limits on it, if any? Spells per day? Magic points? Fatigue?
<br><br>
Dan: "FreyaNile: I try to tow a fine line between what is already familiar. Since the concept and the term armour class is already considerably well known I opted to stick with the well known term. There is a few instances where I opted for this route for accessibilities sake." 
Understandable.
<br><br>
FreyaNile: I decided on a mana system, you have a pool of mana that you can spend as you wish. Each class is bound to their spell list, except for the wizard whom can learn from any spell list but cannot learn spells that restore health. Magic is powerful but it is punishing aswell. When casting a spell or cantrip you must make an elfrot check. To make an elfrot check you roll 2d6, if both dice land on the number 1 (snake eyes), then you gain an amount of elfrot equal to the spell’s level. A creature can tolerate an amount of elfrot equal to their CON score. Once this threshold is passed, the creature falls into a coma until their elfrot score is equal to or lesser than their CON score. When making an elfrot roll for spells of 6th level or higher you gain 1 level of exhaustion. The excitement at the table when the wizard casts a spell is immeasurable.
<br><br>
Dan: Heh. I’ll bet. 🙂
<br><br>
Dan: Finally, does the game include a bestiary, and if so, how large?
<br><br>
FreyaNile: It does include a modest bestiary of wildlife you can expect to find amongst Tirnoch but it is not extensive by any means. Since you can throw in creatures from essentially any dnd edition I invested most of my efforts elsewhere and provided more of a baseline
<br><br>
GOFGrumpyOldFart: I assume that elfrot can be “healed”?
<br><br>
FreyaNile: Aye, theres a couple baked in methods and I encourage GM’s to think of fun ways to heal it
<br><br>
Dan: Do spells require spoken invocations?
<br><br>
FreyaNile: Invocations I would say are specific to the spell, some require more prep than others. Spells will usually require a verbal or somatic component. If the spell is powerful it may require a costly component.
<br><br>
Dan: Ah. I was just wondering if that’s how spells work, in a mana of speaking.
<br><br>
FreyaNile: in a mana of speaking, I see what you did there 😉
<br><br>
Dan: Thanks very much for joining us, @FreyaNile!
<br><br>
FreyaNile: Good gosh, thanks for having me this was a blast!
